# Steady Focus
A lightweight productivity web app: public blog with visitor idea submissions, user task CRUD and a Pomodoro timer.

## Project purpose
Steady Focus helps users plan and run focused work sessions and collect/curate productivity content from visitors.

## Live demo
Heroku URL after deployment

## Features
- Public blog (posts + admin publishing)  
- Visitor blog submission form (saves as submissions for admin review)  
- User accounts (register/login/logout via allauth)  
- Task CRUD with owner-restrictions (private)  
- Client-side Pomodoro timer (public)

### Existing Features
### Future Features (optional)

## User Stories
A [GitHub Kanban board](https://github.com/users/JenE87/projects/10) was set up in Git projects to capture User Stories and follow an agile development approach. For this purpose and to track the project's development progress the project board consists of four columns: Backlog, In Progress, In Review/QA and Done.

### Fixed Bug
- **Server error (500) when submitting blog ideas in production**
  - Cause: `Idea` model migrations were not applied on Heroku.
  - Fix: Commit migration files manually on Heroku. 
- **`{% static %}` template tag throwing errors**
  - Cause: Missing `{% load static %}` at top of templates
  - Fix: Added `{% load static %}` directly under `{% extends "base.html" %}`.
- **`post_list()` got unexpected keyword argument `template_name`**
  - Cause: Passing CBV-only kwargs (`template_name`) to a function-based view.
  - Fix: Added a proper `home()` FBV for the root URL instead of misusing `post_list`.
- **Navbar link not routin to homepage**
  -  Cause: Link pointed to `/` which routed to `post_list` instead of `home`.
  -  Fix: Added `{% url 'home' %}` and set root URL to a real homepage view.
- **Pagination not workong in FBV setup**
  - Cause: Missing `is_paginated`, `page_obj`, and consistent context names.
  - Fix: Added these to the FBV and updated templates accordingly.
- **Audio Notification not playing at timer completion**
  - Cause: An ID mismatch in the HTML/JavaScript (`notification sound` vs `notification-sound`).
  - Fix: Standardizef the element ID.
- **Pomodoro timer crashing at zero**
  - Cause: Attempting to call `.play()` on a global audio variable before the DOM had fully loaded, resulting in a `null` reference error.
  - Fix: Wrapped DOM element assignments within a `DOMContentLoaded` event listener. 
- **CSS hover effects causing visual confusion on detail views**
  - Cause: A global `.card:hover` transition was causing the entire task detail view to "lift", which distracted from functional buttons like "Edit" and "Delete".
  - Fix: Added a `.no-hover-lift` class and updated the CSS selector to `:not(-no-hover-lift)` to exclude single-view cards from the animation. 
- **Django template tags failing inside external JavaScript file**
  - Cause: Attempting to use {% static %} tags directly inside pomodoro.js to define file paths, which Django template engine does not process for static files.
  - Fix: Integrated the audio element directly into the `pomodoro.html` template using Django tags and referenced the element in JavaScript via its ID.
- **The custom `stlye.css` (incl. background, color vars, specific timer font size) was not loading on deployed Heroku app, resulting in a plain, unstyled look.**
  - Cause: The `staticfiles/` directory, which is generated by Django's `collectstatic` command and meant for production use by Whitenoise, was accidently tracked and commited to the Git repo. This conflict prevented the WhiteNoise middleware from running clean and correct static file collection during deployment.
  - Fix: The cachhed `staticfiles/` folder was removed from Git tracking (`git rm -r --cached staticfiles`), the directory was added to the `.gitignore` file to prevent future tracking, and a final push was performed to force Heroku to run a clean build and static file collection.

### Unfixed Bugs
- **Lexend font and primary color not consistently applying to all headings**
  - Cause: Potential CSS specificity conflicts with Bootstrap's default heading styles or specific card and container classes overriding the global font-family and primary color rule.
  - Status: Parked for future styling refactor; core functionality prioritized.
- **Words breaking mid-letter inside Bootsrap cards**
  - Cause: Browser default word splitting behaviour.
  - Status: Tried adding CSS `word-break: normal; overflow-wrap: break-word;` and refined clamping styles. Bug improved, but not fixed yet. Parked for future adjustment and prioritized core functionality.
